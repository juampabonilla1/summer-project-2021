# summer-project-2021

Python software to model quantum error correction by concatenation of toric code lattices.

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/juampabonilla1/summer-project-2021.git
```

## Usage

The program src/simulation_starter.py runs N simulations of error input, syndrome measurement, recovery operator creation and correction on the square periodic toric code lattice by concatenating. 

```bash
python src/simulation_starter.py p=<> L=<> N=<> bias=<>
```
